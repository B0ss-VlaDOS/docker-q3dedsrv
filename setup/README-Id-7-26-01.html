<h1>NOTABLE CHANGES IN QUAKE III AND TEAM ARENA - (1.29f BETA)</h1>

<p defanged_style='margin-left:.25in'><b></b></p>

<p><b>NEW id CREATED PRO MAPS -</b> One of our newer employees,
Fred Nilsson, is an avid fan tournament style game play, and is
very interested in the professional gaming community. Via feedback
from professional Quake 3 players, Fred has made some modifications
to some of the more popular maps that shipped with Quake 3
including &ldquo;The Camp Grounds&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lost World&rdquo;,
&ldquo;The Proving Grounds&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Vertical
Vengeance&rdquo; You can play them in the single player game by
advancing to tier 7, or run them on your server by using the map
names &ldquo;PRO-Q3DM6&rdquo;, &ldquo;PRO-Q3DM13&rdquo;,
&ldquo;PRO-Q3TOURNEY2&rdquo; and, &ldquo;PRO-Q3TOURNEY4&rdquo;.
These are a lot of fun! Give them a try!</p>

<p defanged_style='margin-left:.25in'><b></b></p>

<p><b>NEW NETWORK CODE</b> - There is a new compression system
built into the network code of the latest point release.
Essentially, this reduces the bandwidth usage of Quake 3 and Team
Arena by a ratio of 5:1 over previous versions of the game. Modem
players, as well as everyone else, should experience a significant
improvement in internet game play because of this.</p>

<p><b>AUTO UPDATE SYSTEM</b> - Within this release is an Auto
Update system that can be used to at any time to check for and
download updates to Quake 3 and Team Arena. When you install the
point release a file will be created in your Quake III Arena
directory and in the Start Menu called, &ldquo;Check For Quake III
Arena Updates&rdquo;. Running this file will check our servers for
updates and notify you if there is a newer version or inform you
that your files are up to date. The auto updater will create a
directory on your C: where downloaded updates will be stored. It is
important that you DO NOT delete this directory.&nbsp; If you plan
to uninstall Quake III, make sure to uninstall all of the point
releases as well.</p>

<p><b>NEW RAIL, ROCKET LAUNCHER, PLASMA GUN, and LIGHTNING GUN
EFFECTS</b> - There have been several new weapon effects that
we&rsquo;ve managed to sneak into this release. We&rsquo;ve turned
them off in the game by default, but you can enable them from the
console by pressing the ~ key and typing the following
commands:</p>

<p defanged_style='text-indent:.5in'>\cg_oldRail
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(enables the new rail effect)</p>

<p defanged_style='text-indent:.5in'>\cg_oldRocket
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(enables the new rocket effect)</p>

<p defanged_style='text-indent:.5in'>\cg_oldPlasma
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(enables the new plasma effect)</p>

<p defanged_style='text-indent:.5in'>\cg_trueLightning
0.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(enables the new lightning gun effect)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p defanged_style='margin-left:.5in'>In addition, the colors of the
new rail effect can be changed with the cvars \color1 and \color2
with values of 1 through 8. (ex. \color1 1 or \color2 5). The new
Rail gun effect was donated from the Alliance mod team <a href=
"http://www.planetquake.com/alliance/">http://www.planetquake.com/alliance/</a>
The new Lightning gun effect was donated from the CPMA mod team <a
href="http://www.promode.org/">http://www.promode.org/</a></p>

<p defanged_style='margin-left:.25in'><b></b></p>

<p><b>NEW CHEATING COUNTER MEASURES -</b> There has been quite a
bit of new code added to make it much more difficult to cheat and
hack the game. We&rsquo;d tell you more, but that would be
defeating the purpose&hellip; Rest assured that it will be harder
to cheat than ever before.</p>

<p defanged_style='margin-left:.25in'><b></b></p>

<p><b>NEW PROTOCOL CHANGE -</b> The changes made to improve network
code and prevent cheating will make this and future version of
Quake 3 and Team Arena incompatible with older versions. This will
affect older versions of demos as well. We wish it were possible to
maintain game compatibility through each release, however major
code changes limit our ability to do so.</p>

<p><b></b></p>

<p><b>QUAKE III ARENA AND TEAM ARENA EDITING CHANGES</b></p>

<p><b></b></p>

<p><b defanged_style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>TEAM SELECTION
-</b> When a player starts a game with map or devmap the team logos
displayed will be the last two teams used in the single player
game. The console cvars <b>g_blueteam</b> and <b defanged_style=
'mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>g_redteam</b> commands will allow
server admins to change the teams being played on dedicated
servers.</p>

<p defanged_style='margin-left:.25in'></p>

<p><b defanged_style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Q3:TA TEAM
CREATION</b> - It is now possible to create original Team Arena
teams with new team logos, body models, head models, voices and
skins. Previously the code had been designed to limit the game to
use of two body models (James &amp; Janet). With this point
release, hobbyists who know their way around the skills of&nbsp;
model-making, animating, and skinning can make new team content for
Team Arena. The &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; details for the creation of
new teams are extensive and will be documented in a separate
publication. These new teams will be available for use in single
player, and multiplayer games.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b defanged_style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>INCREASED
VERSATILITY FOR USER-CREATED TEAM SKINS IN Q3A AND Q3:TA</b> - When
a user-created skin for a model is accompanied by a set of
similarly named matching team color skins, the game will now use
those instead of the model&rsquo;s default team skin. For things to
work right you have to have the following in the pak file for a
blue team skin for and example skin for the Crash model name
Hellion:</p>

<p></p>

<p>
Hellion_blue.tga&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
models\players\crash\</p>

<p>
Hellion_blue_f.tga&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
models\players\crash\</p>

<p>
Hellion_blue_t.tga&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
models\players\crash\</p>

<p>
Head_Hellion_blue.skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
models\players\crash\</p>

<p>
Icon_Hellion_blue.tga&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
models\players\crash\</p>

<p>
Lower_Hellion_blue.skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
models\players\crash\</p>

<p>
Upper_Hellion_blue.skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
models\players\crash\</p>

<p>
Head_blue.skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
models\players\crash\Hellion\</p>

<p></p>

<p defanged_style='margin-left:.5in'>Note that the
head_hellion_blue.skin file must be in the crash directory and the
head_blue.skin must be in the crash/Hellion directory for the model
to work properly. A model configured in this manner will be
back-compatible with earlier versions of Q3A.</p>

<p></p>

<p defanged_style='margin-left:.5in'>The search process for model
skins has been refined for core Q3A and Q3:TA. Details will be in
the Team Creation document to follow. Essentially, the game will
look deeper into model directories when looking for model head
selections.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b defanged_style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>NEW MODEL
ANIMATION COMMANDS &ndash;</b></p>

<p defanged_style='margin-left:.5in'>Fixedlegs&nbsp; : put in the
animation .cfg this command freezes the programmatic rotation of
the legs.</p>

<p>Fixedtorso : put in the animation .cfg this command freezes the
programmatic rotation of the torso.</p>

<p><b>MAPMAKING CHANGES </b> &ndash; ENTITIES CAN BE SET TO APPEAR (OR NOT)
BASED ON GAME VERSION.</p>

<p>Map makers now have the option to make their
maps use different entity sets if a game is being played in
original Quake III Arena or in Quake III: Team Arena. By adding one
of the following key/value epairs, the mapper can create
conditional tests that look for what code is being used or NOT
being used to run the game.</h1>

<p defanged_style='text-indent:.5in'>KEY: "notq3a"&nbsp; (i.e.; Not
Quake III Arena)</p>

<p defanged_style='margin-left:.5in'>VALUE: "1" or "0"&nbsp; The
default value is zero for an unmarked entity. If this value is set
to 1, the marked entity will not appear if the game is played with
"vanilla" (unmodified) Quake III Arena game code. Example: A
Chaingun from Q3:TA could be marked with this epair. It would show
up in Q3:TA game, but not in a Q3A game.</p>

<p defanged_style='text-indent:.5in'>KEY: "notta" (i.e.; Not
Quake&nbsp;III: Team Arena)</p>

<p defanged_style='margin-left:.5in'>VALUE: "1" or "0"&nbsp; The
default value is zero for an unmarked entity. If this value is set
to 1, the marked entity will not appear if the game is played with
the Team Arena expansion set and its game types.</p>

<p defanged_style='margin-left:.5in'>Should you want an entity to
NOT appear in either game type (Q3A or Q3TA), you would set BOTH
keys to 1. In this case, it would work with any other game mod
which supports that entity</p>

<p>If botplay is desired, these epairs should not be used on
entities, such as func_statics, that significantly change the flow
of the game map.</p>

<p></p>
